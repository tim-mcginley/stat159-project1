### Conclusions

This project has been a great hands-on method of learning the mechanics of a reproducible workflow.  I'll take this space to discuss some of the lessons learned and some other takeaways from the experience.

Front to back, the project has taken me about three hours to complete. Most of this time has been spent physically writing, which was easily the most challenging part.  The majority of the rest of the time was spent figuring out various syntax issues, primarily on Google or by going through the Stat 159 github and previous lab work.  Other than this research, I didn't use any outside resources other than MacDown, which has been really helpful when it comes to the actual writing. 

I did this almost entirely on my own, save for a few questions I had answered by a friend of mine who completed the project before I didâ€“ mainly about how to use the GitHub website, which I am not super familar with.  I didn't get "stuck" really at any point, although it did take me a second to "get" the whole phony makefile target procedure.
