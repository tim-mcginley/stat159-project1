More and more of the research done around the world relies on a wealth of data.  Maintaining large amounts of data in an organized manner suitable to drawing conclusions has become a real challenge, and poorly presented data can lead to questions about the veracity of findings.  For this and many other reasons, studying methods to reduce errors and allow for reproducible resutls is important.  This project goes through a mock workflow for a data-driven project and utilizes many of the tools used to create reproducible and collaborative research.
